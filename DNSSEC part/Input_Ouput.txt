Your program should take a domain name as input and output according to three cases:
1- DNSSEC is configured and everything is verified (output the verified IP Address)
2- DNSSEC is not enabled (output “DNSSEC not supported”)
3- DNSSEC is configured but the digital signature could NOT be verified. An example is http://www.dnssec-failed.org/, a site run by Comcast to specifically test whether or not your resolver has implemented DNSSEC correctly. They have a DNSKEY registered with .org that cannot resolve the digital signature at the www.dnssec-failed.org nameserver. In this case, output “DNSSec verification failed”.
